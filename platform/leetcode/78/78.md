# Subsets
#array #backtracking #dfs

Generate all possible subsets (the power set) of a given list of unique integers.

**Approach**: Recursive / Backtracking  
- At each step, choose to include or exclude the current element.  
- Base case: when index reaches `n`, record the current subset.  
- Time complexity: O(n * 2^n)  
- Space complexity: O(n * 2^n) (to store results) + O(n) recursion stack.
